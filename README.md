# CESM-Builds
 Source Code and Use Instructions for CESM on Scinet's Niagara, as well as macOS for the bold and brave souls looking to run the single column version of the model (SCAM)- CFG Edition

# Source Code and Picking a Particular Version
I'm just going to be discussing running/modifying the model version that's already sitting in my home directory, as it's been modified accordingly for Niagara specifically. However, I'll also throw in some comments on acquiring your own model version, with some helpful links and slides. Eventually, I'll get the single column model up and running on my mac and i'll add all of that data and scripts here.

## Pre-configured version from my home directory (CESM2.1.0)
Log into scinet and pop over to my home directory:
'''
git clone https://github.com/JohnVirgin/CESM-Builds/Niagara/cesm2_1_0
'''
